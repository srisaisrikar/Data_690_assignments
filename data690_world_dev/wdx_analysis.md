GDP one of the most common abbrevation used by all the countries across the world which is a financial indicator of the goods and services generated there in a specific time frame, typically a quarter or a year. It is believed that countries with high GDP have high standard of living and the country is progressing with strong economy. **But Is it really true ?** Let's find out in this study...

This study illustrates the impact of GDP on other sectors such as, Education, Health, Agriculture .This study compares the data from the emerging BRICS nations.
The informal group of early 2000s top rising economies that included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa has since seen drastically distinct growth paths. It is still unclear how important they are to the world economy at a time of great geopolitical unpredictability. Global economic power has undergone an extraordinary reconfiguration over the last two decades. This has been principally fueled by the rise of China and, to a lesser extent, the BRICS nations in general, which also include Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa in addition to the East Asian giant.The source of this study is taken from [THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT EXPLORER](https://www.worlddev.xyz/).

<img src="/data690_world_dev/Charts/FDI line graph.png" alt="FDI(2016-2020)" title="FDI">

<img src="/data690_world_dev/Charts/scatter plot 2020.png" alt="Bubble chart" title="Bubble chart">
From the above bubble charts which is plotted between the Unemployment, GDP per capita and the foreign investment inflows, the countries like India, South Africa and Russia saw an increase in the unemployment rate even though the GDP is at a positive trend. The surprising trend is where there is a positive investment of foreign companies in India, there is still an increase in numbers of unemployment. Russia has the highest literacy rate with 99 percent,while India lags behind with 74 percent. With this analysis even though there is a growth in GDP per capita and there is an investment of foreign comapnies, the emerging superpower nation,India, is falling behind in creating job oppurtunities, the reson why manny people are moving to western countries in search of oppurtunities, on the other hand countries like South Africa and Brazil are failing to bring foreign investment and also failing to provide job oppurtunities evnthough their GDP is at a positive rate. 

Below is the line graph of unemployemnt rate of BRICS

### Conclusion
A cross country comparison for the BRICS shows that economic progress alone may not necessarily translate into a higher quality of life for these economies. The countries which lag behind some in GDP per capita, are more progressive in some indicators. Since progress in every sector of a nation may also affect its economic prosperity, it is crucial for nations to undertake measures in the all major spheres in which they are lagging behind. While India still needs to invest its resources in meeting its basic human needs, countries such as China and Russia need to attract foreign investments which can boost their economy as well as provide employment.
