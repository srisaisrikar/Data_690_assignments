GDP one of the most common abbrevation used by all the countries across the world which is a financial indicator of the goods and services generated there in a specific time frame, typically a quarter or a year. It is believed that countries with high GDP have high standard of living and the country is progressing with strong economy. **But Is it really true ?** Let's find out in this study...

This study illustrates the impact of GDP on other sectors such as, Education, Health, Environment etc.This study compares the data from the emerging BRICS nations.
The informal group of early 2000s top rising economies that included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa has since seen drastically distinct growth paths. It is still unclear how important they are to the world economy at a time of great geopolitical unpredictability. Global economic power has undergone an extraordinary reconfiguration over the last two decades. This has been principally fueled by the rise of China and, to a lesser extent, the BRICS nations in general, which also include Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa in addition to the East Asian giant.The source of this study is taken from [THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT EXPLORER] (https://www.worlddev.xyz/).
